## Differences from RAW

### Tanuki
* Tactical Retreat doesn't give you the fleeing condition, and instead just gives you the +10ft bonus to speed directly. 
### Kitsune
* Star Orb: Instead of giving you a familiar (which don't exist in Dawnsbury Days), the Star Orb is an item which allows you to use two familiar abilities from the tabletop game. The abilities are Orb Restoration (emulating Restorative Familiar) and Orb Focus (emulating Familiar Focus). These both take 1 action, as if commanding your familiar.
* Dark Fields Kitsune: The tabletop original gives you the benefits of Intimidating Glare but without giving you the feat; this mod just gives you the feat.
* Kitsune Spell Familiarity: Ghost Sound is not present in Dawnsbury Days, so there are only two spell choices. To change the prepared spell, use the retraining menu.
### Tengu
* Mountainkeeper Tengu: You can't choose the tradition of the spell; it's always a primal spell. (This serves little to no mechanical purpose in Dawnsbury Days.)
* Skyborn Tengu: Original fall damage effect doesn't make sense in Dawnsbury Days. Instead, gives a +1 to saves and improves successes to crits against air effects, as well as granting the Powerful Leap feat.
* Stormtossed Tengu: Doesn't grant the targetting benefit against creatures in rain or fog (no way to implement in-game.)
* Wavediver Tengu: Swim speed is equal to land speed, like other swimming creatures in Dawnsbury Days.
* One-Toed Hop: Removes mention of vertical Leaps (because the game is 2D), and explicitly mentions the Powerful Leap synergy in a Special section of the description
* Squawk!: Original cannot be used in combat, so it is completely replaced. Once per day, you can use a reaction when you fail a check to Demoralize to reroll the check and take the higher result.
* Tengu Weapon Familiarity: To change the sword you've practiced with, use the retraining menu.
* Uncanny Agility: Just grants the Feather Step feat instead of granting it's benefits on specific kinds of terrain. Doesn't grant Steady Balance because Balancing doesn't exist in Dawnsbury Days.
