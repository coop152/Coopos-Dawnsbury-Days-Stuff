# Dawnsbury Days Tanuki Ancestry

A mod for Dawnsbury Days which adds some Ancestries that I think are cool. Currently adds:

* Tanuki
	* Even-tempered Heritage
	* Virtuous Heritage
	* Courageous Heritage	
	* Iron Belly Feat
	* Scorched on the Crackling Mountain Feat
* Kitsune
    * Earthly Wilds Heritage
	* Frozen Wind Heritage
	* Celestial Envoy Heritage
	* Dark Fields Heritage
	* Empty Sky Heritage
	* Foxfire Feat
	* Retractable Claws Feat
	* Kitsune Spell Familiarity Feat
	* Star Orb Feat

(Unfortunately, anything related to Change Shape is missing, because it's useless in combat.)

## Differences from RAW

* Courageous Tanuki: Tactical Retreat doesn't give you the fleeing condition, and instead just gives you the +10ft bonus to speed directly. 
* Star Orb: Instead of giving you a familiar (which don't exist in Dawnsbury Days), the Star Orb is an item which allows you to use two familiar abilities from the tabletop game. The abilities are Orb Restoration (emulating Restorative Familiar) and Orb Focus (emulating Familiar Focus). These both take 1 action, as if commanding your familiar.
* Dark Fields Kitsune: The tabletop original gives you the benefits of Intimidating Glare but without giving you the feat; this mod just gives you the feat.
* Kitsune Spell Familiarity: Ghost Sound is not present in Dawnsbury Days, so there are only two spell choices. To change the prepared spell, use the retraining menu.
